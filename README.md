Ansible is a tool that helps you automate tasks on multiple computers or servers at once. In the context of DevOps.
 ---

1. It has Agentless architecture : Ansible works by connecting to the machines remotely, so you don't need to install anything extra on them.

2. **Inventory File :** You create a list of the machines you want Ansible to manage in a file called an inventory. 
   - It is named as inventory.ini 
	




```yaml

``` 
	





Ansible is a powerful automation tool that plays a crucial role in various aspects of the software development and deployment lifecycle

Here's how Ansible fits into the DevOps ecosystem:


- **Infrastructure as Code (IaC).**
   - Ansible allows you to define your infrastructure as code using playbooks and roles.
   - By treating infrastructure as code, you can version control your infrastructure configuration, making 
     it easier to track changes, collaborate with team members, and maintain a consistent environment.


- **Configuration Management.**
- **Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD).**
- **Environment Provisioning.**
- **Application Deployment.**
- **Orchestration.**
- **Scalability and Flexibility.**
- **Collaboration and Sharing.**
- **Continuous Monitoring and Compliance.**
